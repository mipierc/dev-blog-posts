<h4 id="test-driven-development"><strong>Test-Driven
Development</strong></h4>
<p>Testing is the most important part of the development process. In my
programming experience, I don’t believe I have run a single program and
had it function as intended on the first attempt. Test-driven
Development or TDD for short is a software development process reliant
on converting requirements into test cases prior to the implementation.
It essentially switches the traditional order, where you would develop
the software first and then test it. TDD works best with modular,
flexible, and extensible code. This is partially because this
methodology requires developers to focus on smaller units that can be
written and tested and brought together later. It inspires smaller and
more focused classes and looser coupling. Inversely, it doesn’t function
well when full functional tests are required to determine success or
failure because of the extensive use of unit tests. Some examples would
be user interfaces and programs that interact with databases. The
developer who writes the test is also writing the code. This can cause
things to get missed, as the test may share the same blind spots as the
code.</p>
<h4 id="oop-vs.-functional"><strong>OOP vs. Functional</strong></h4>
<p>OOP, or Object-oriented programming, is a computer programming model
that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and
logic. OOP focuses on the objects developers want to manipulate rather
than the logic required to manipulate them. OOP has become increasingly
popular and is best suited for large, complex, and active software
projects. The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the
method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are
divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code
reusability, scalability, and efficiency. The structure of OOP include
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classes</strong> are user-defined data types that act as the
blueprint for individual objects, attributes, and methods.</li>
<li><strong>Objects</strong> are instances of a class created with
specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects
or an abstract entities. When class is defined initially, the
description is the only object that is defined.</li>
<li><strong>Methods</strong> are functions that are defined inside a
class that describe the behaviors of an object. Each method contained in
class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object.
Additionally, the subroutines contained in an object are called instance
methods. Programmers use methods for reusability or keeping
functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong> are defined in the class template and
represent the state of an object. Objects will have data stored in the
attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Functional programming is the opposite of OOP, instead of focusing on
objects, it focuses on binding everything in pure mathematical
functions. It focuses on “what to solve”. It uses expressions instead of
statements. The structure of functional programming include the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pure functions</strong> have two main properties. First,
they always produce the same output for the same arguments irrespective
of anything else. Secondly, they have no side effects i.e. they do not
modify any arguments or local/global variables or input/output streams.
Later property is called immutability. The pure function’s only result
is the value it returns. They are deterministic.</li>
<li><strong>Recursion</strong> There are no “for” or “while” loops in
functional languages. Iteration in functional languages is implemented
through recursion. Recursive functions repeatedly call themselves, until
it reaches the base case.</li>
<li><strong>Variables are Immutable</strong> In functional programming,
we can’t modify a variable after it’s been initialized. We can create
new variables – but we can’t modify existing variables, and this really
helps to maintain the state throughout the runtime of a program.</li>
</ul>
