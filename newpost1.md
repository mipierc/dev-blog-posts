Hello, fellow developers! It's a new year and time for a DevBlog post! I hope 2022 has treated you well so far, and that you enjoyed your holidays. Let's get into some of the large-scale issues that face fullstack development.

#### __Expanding Role of Web Developers__

There are two main roles in web development. There are both front-end and back-end developers. Front-end developers focus on the browser and back-end developers focus on the servers. Through time the job has evolved, but the distinction between front-end and back-end is still largely held. Front-end developers focus on the browser requires them to understand how users use the browser. User's browsers vary in window size, light mode or dark mode, monitors have different properties, such as pixel density, internet speeds can vary, and so much more. When creating products, it's important to consider all of the unknowns. The end user is the most important focal point when designing and developing. 

#### __The Growth of JavaScript__

Front-end developers design for browsers. To design for a browser, developers must use the languages used for development for browsers; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are other ways to develop for the web, like using other templates for HTML or CSS, and JavaScript can be developed using a framework, but the browser will look at the raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over the past decade, JavaScript has evolved quite a bit. JavaScript's primary use was for some basic interactive effects, but has quickly turned into the most used language in the stack when designing and developing for the web. JavaScript has largely taken over front-end development because while being powerful, is also ergonomic and lightweight. The frameworks built for JavaScript maintain the same power and ergonomics, making it the most popular choice for web development. JavaScript and it's accompanying frameworks have focuses on components. Instead of focusing on pages, JavaScript development focuses on components on each page. This allows for greater abstraction, and improves workability and editablity of web applications. Components should be built as templates, so they can be easily adapted to different aspects of the site. HTML and CSS are still important aspects of web development, but JavaScript is quickly on the rise. More employers and looking for developers who can build apps using JavaScript, and job postings for pure HTML and CSS design-focused developers is dwindling.

#### __JavaScript Frameworks__

The developer stack has developed greatly over the past decade. Many older stacks focused soley on back-end technologies. The LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) only consists of backend technologies. For front-end developers, it means nothing. Stacks have evolved with the rise of JavaScript, however. A popular stack, MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node), includes Angular, which is a JavaScript framework and increases conversation about front-end being an important component of the stack.
