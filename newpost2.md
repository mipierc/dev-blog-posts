#### __The Rise of UX__

User Experience Design, or UX, is the new black in development processes. UX has become the main focal point for executives and developers alike as the key for product promotion. So what exactly is user experience? User experience is the way a person feels while interacting with a system, ranging from a website to a mobile app with everything in between. It has become so important because it focuses on fulfilling a user's needs. Designing a meaningful user experience allows you to guide customers to products more easily leading to business success. It is important to ask who has the problem, what is the problem, how will it be resolved, what does the resolution achieves, and how will the final product look and function? It is important to keep those 5 questions in mind, and each should be answered in the design process.

#### __Search Engine Optimization__

Search engine optimization, or SEO, is the process of making your site better for search engines. SEO is one of the most important aspects of running a successful webpage. In order to visit your site, people need to know it exists. Making it easier for them to find it will improve traffic to the site. One of the most basic requirements is having text on the page. By storing titles or page content in images, videos, or animations, it can be difficult for search engines to recognize. If you're using a graphic for a site name or logo, make sure the site name is also written in text on the webpage. Keeping up with current trends is also important. Using title tags is also important. Many search engines will use the title tag to display results, so you should be as descriptive as possible. In addition, adding descriptive meta tags will also improve results as they may be used as page snippets in search results. If your site is themed around fall, you will be less recommended during the spring and summer months as searches increase for other areas. For example, if you're selling ice cream, update the site to account for changes in seasons or trends. It is also useful to get mentioned on other sites. Getting your site listed in online news services will also improve search results.
