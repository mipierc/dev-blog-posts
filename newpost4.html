<h4 id="databases"><strong>Databases</strong></h4>
<p>With the growing need to store large amounts of data, databases must
be highly effective at what they are designed to do. There is a large
variety of different databases. Some of the most commonly used
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hierarchical databases</li>
<li>Network databases</li>
<li>Object-Oriented databases</li>
<li>Relational databases</li>
<li>NoSQL databases</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="hierarchical-databases"><strong>Hierarchical
Databases</strong></h5>
<p>In hierarchical databases the data is organized into ranks or levels,
where data is categorized based on a common linkage point. Using a
university database as an example, students and faculty would be stored
in a lower rank, and departments would be stored a level higher since
they share that commonality. A higher ranked table can have multiple
lower ranked tables, but not the other way around. It is difficult to
add data to these types of databases since it requires such a lengthy
traversal though tables.</p>
<h5 id="network-databases"><strong>Network Databases</strong></h5>
<p>A network database is a hierarchial database, but the child records
can be associated with multiple parent records. Using the university
database from the previous example, a student would be able to be linked
with both the department and with another higher level record, such as a
club. Unfortunately with network databases, it is difficult and often
impossible to alter the database structure due to its complexity.</p>
<h5 id="object-oriented-databases"><strong>Object-Oriented
Databases</strong></h5>
<p>If youâ€™re familiar with Object-Oriented Programming, this database
structure is easy to relate with. Information stored is represented as
objects, with each object having data linked to it. For example, the
university is made up of people. There are students and there are
faculty. A person may have a name and identification number, and the
person table can be linked through relationships to other tables, such
as student and faculty. A student may have a GPA and a professor may
have a salary. Querying this style database is quick and efficent.</p>
<h5 id="relational-databases"><strong>Relational Databases</strong></h5>
<p>Relational databases are considered to be the most mature and are the
most used in production. In these style databases, every piece of
information has a relationship with every other piece of information.
They are used in Web-Ap interfaces to serve as a repository for user
data. You can use SQL to interact with it, and is easy to understand. It
is also easy to scale and traverse the database when compared to
hierarchical databases.</p>
<h5 id="nosql"><strong>NoSQL</strong></h5>
<p>NoSQL databases are simple in design. They use different data
structures than those used in a default relational database and can
often run faster. It is only suitable in some sitations, however. It is
easy to scale, but has some major drawbacks. The biggest drawback is
having a large document size. They also lack a GUI, so interacting with
them can be more cumbersome. The most popular NoSQL databases include
MongoDB and Cassandra.</p>
