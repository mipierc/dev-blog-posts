<p>Hello, fellow developers! It’s a new year and time for a DevBlog
post! I hope 2022 has treated you well so far, and that you enjoyed your
holidays. Let’s get into some of the large-scale issues that face
fullstack development.</p>
<h4 id="expanding-role-of-web-developers"><strong>Expanding Role of Web
Developers</strong></h4>
<p>There are two main roles in web development. There are both front-end
and back-end developers. Front-end developers focus on the browser and
back-end developers focus on the servers. Through time the job has
evolved, but the distinction between front-end and back-end is still
largely held. Front-end developers focus on the browser requires them to
understand how users use the browser. User’s browsers vary in window
size, light mode or dark mode, monitors have different properties, such
as pixel density, internet speeds can vary, and so much more. When
creating products, it’s important to consider all of the unknowns. The
end user is the most important focal point when designing and
developing.</p>
<h4 id="the-growth-of-javascript"><strong>The Growth of
JavaScript</strong></h4>
<p>Front-end developers design for browsers. To design for a browser,
developers must use the languages used for development for browsers;
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are other ways to develop for the web,
like using other templates for HTML or CSS, and JavaScript can be
developed using a framework, but the browser will look at the raw HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript. Over the past decade, JavaScript has evolved quite
a bit. JavaScript’s primary use was for some basic interactive effects,
but has quickly turned into the most used language in the stack when
designing and developing for the web. JavaScript has largely taken over
front-end development because while being powerful, is also ergonomic
and lightweight. The frameworks built for JavaScript maintain the same
power and ergonomics, making it the most popular choice for web
development. JavaScript and it’s accompanying frameworks have focuses on
components. Instead of focusing on pages, JavaScript development focuses
on components on each page. This allows for greater abstraction, and
improves workability and editablity of web applications. Components
should be built as templates, so they can be easily adapted to different
aspects of the site. HTML and CSS are still important aspects of web
development, but JavaScript is quickly on the rise. More employers and
looking for developers who can build apps using JavaScript, and job
postings for pure HTML and CSS design-focused developers is
dwindling.</p>
<h4 id="javascript-frameworks"><strong>JavaScript
Frameworks</strong></h4>
<p>The developer stack has developed greatly over the past decade. Many
older stacks focused soley on back-end technologies. The LAMP stack
(Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) only consists of backend technologies.
For front-end developers, it means nothing. Stacks have evolved with the
rise of JavaScript, however. A popular stack, MEAN (Mongo, Express,
Angular, and Node), includes Angular, which is a JavaScript framework
and increases conversation about front-end being an important component
of the stack.</p>
